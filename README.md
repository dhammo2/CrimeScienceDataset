## Terrorism
* The Global Terrorism Database
  - *Description*: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017 (with additional annual updates planned for the future). Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as transnational and international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 cases. For each GTD incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and--when identifiable--the group or individual responsible.

## Forensics
* Footwear Impression Database
  - *Description*: The databases contain samples of footwear impression evidence, that have been secured at crime scenes by forensic experts. The digital images were produced either by scanning gelatin lifters or by photographing the impression. Moreover, 1175 reference impressions are included in the databases. The reference samples have been produced by applying gelatine lifters to the outsole of the reference shoe, followed by scanning the lifters. Thus, the data generating process is very similar for both types of impressions. The data is labelled, meaning that for each crime scene impression, the name of the corresponding reference impression is known.

## Other
* UK Missing Persons Database
  - *Description*: The aim of our website is to publicise information about unidentified people and remains, enlisting the public to help maximise the chances of identification. It is hoped the website will empower families of missing people to play an active part in searching for their loved ones and bring vital closure if they are identified. Our website also features general information around missing person investigations and is intended to be a valuable resource.

## Computer Vision Datasets
* Real-world Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos
  - *Description*: We construct a new large-scale dataset, called UCF-Crime, to evaluate our method. It consists of long untrimmed surveillance videos which cover 13 realworld anomalies, including Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Road Accident, Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, Robbery, Shooting, Stealing, Shoplifting, and Vandalism. These anomalies are selected because they have a significant impact on public safety.
